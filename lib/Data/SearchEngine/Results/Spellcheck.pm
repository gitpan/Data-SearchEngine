Data::SearchEngine::Results::Spellcheck - spellcheck role for Spellchecking

=head1 VERSION

version 0.23

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Data::SeachEngine::Foo;

    with 'Data::SearchEngine::Results::Spellcheck';
    
    sub search {
        # do stuff
        $results->set_spell_suggestion('popuar', 
          Data::SearchEngine::Results::Spellcheck::Suggestion->new(
            word => 'popular',  # the suggested replacement
            frequency => 12     # optional, how often it occurs in the index
          );
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides storage and methods for retrieving spellcheck information.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 spell_collation

Intended to hold the 'suggested' spelling result from spellchecking.  A search
for "basebll bat" would likely have a collation of "baseball bat".  It is so
named as it contains a collation of the best results for the various tokens.

=head2 spell_frequencies

Hash containing the original token in as the key and the frequency it occurs
in the index as the value.  This may not be used by all backends.

=head2 spell_sugguestions

HashRef of spellcheck suggestions for this query.  The HashRef is keyed by the
word for which spellcheck suggestions are being provided and the values are
the suggestions.

=head2 spelled_correctly

Boolean value to signal to the front end if the query was spelled correctly.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_spell_frequency ($word)

Gets the frequency for the specified word.

=head2 set_spell_frequency ($word, $frequency)

Sets the frequency for the provided word.

=head2 get_spell_suggestion ($word)

Gets the suggestion with the specified name.  Returns undef if one does not exist.

=head2 set_spell_suggestion

Sets the suggestion with the specified name.

=head2 spell_suggestion_words

Returns an array of all the keys of C<suggestions>.
